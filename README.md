# LudumDare43

This is a simple 2D platformer game for LudumDare 43 based on the theme "Sacrifices must be made". I worked for 1 hr till now to make a simple level and some mechanics. The game still requires art and more programming. As of right now game jam ends in 1 day , 17 hours, 49 mins. 

So, this morning at 7:30 was the end of the game jam. And till last night i wasn't confident, whether i should post this game or not. But this morning got up at 6:30, and i want it as my first submission. With some last minute changes, submitted the game.
